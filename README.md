# Tree of Thoughts

## Introduction
We decided to reproduce the Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models paper by Shunyu Yao, Dian Yu, Jeffrey Zhao, Izhak Shafran, Thomas L. Griffiths, Yuan Cao, and Karthik Narasimhan. In this paper, ToT introduces a deliberate and structured reasoning framework by generating intermediate "thoughts" as steps toward problem solving.
