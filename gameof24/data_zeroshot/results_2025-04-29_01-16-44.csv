"[5, 6, 8, 13]","To obtain 24 using the numbers 5, 6, 8, and 13, you can use the following mathematical expression:

\[ 
(13 - 6) * (8 - 5) = 24 
\]

Breaking it down:
- \( 13 - 6 = 7 \)
- \( 8 - 5 = 3 \)
- \( 7 * 3 = 21 \)

Upon reevaluation:

A correct method to obtain 24 is:

\[ 
(8 - 5) * 6 + 13 = 24 
\]

Breaking it down:
- \( 8 - 5 = 3 \)
- \( 3 * 6 = 18 \)
- \( 18 + 6 = 24 \)

Thus a correct answer is:

\[ 
(13 + 5 - 6) * 3 = 24 
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
(5 + 6 + 8 - 5) = 24
\]

"[5, 8, 11, 13]","To obtain 24 using the numbers 5, 8, 11, and 13, you can use the following expression:

(11 - 5) * (13 - 8) = 6 * 5 = 30. 

Unfortunately, that doesn't reach 24. Let's try another approach:

8 * (13 - 11) + 5 = 8 * 2 + 5 = 16 + 5 = 21. 

Let's correct a mistake: 

11 + 13 - 8 - 5 = 24 - this doesn't yield 24 as well.

Now, let’s try another calculation:

(13 - 11) * 8 + 5 = 2 * 8 + 5 = 16 + 5 = 21.

It seems tricky to reach 24 with that set.

After testing different combinations, we could express:

(13 + 11) - (8 + 5) = 24 or any combinations that exist might be valid.

A successful equation actually would be to try:

(8 + 5) + 11 = 24 also won’t yield but represents one of the combinations.

The combinations are limited and don’t yield exact outputs.

Unfortunately, it seems difficult to reach exactly 24 using just basic operations on these numbers."
