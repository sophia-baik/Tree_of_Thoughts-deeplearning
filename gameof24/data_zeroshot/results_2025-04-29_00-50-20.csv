Breaking it down:
- First, calculate 6 * 4 = 24
- Then calculate 9 - 7 = 2
- Finally, 24 - 2 = 22

Sorry, but that is incorrect. Let's try another approach:

(7 - 4) * (9 - 6) = 3 * 3 = 9 

Sorry for the confusion, here’s the correct operations for 24:

(9 - 7) * (6 + 4) = 2 * 10 = 20 

I apologize again, but let's try:

4 * 6 = 24 

It seems that the correct equation has not been derived properly. The numbers provided do not neatly give a 24 through simple operations under basic mathematical principles. If you have any other numbers or specific operations you want me to try, please let me know, and I will certainly assist!"

Explanation:
- First, we multiply 10 and 2 to get 20.
- Then, we subtract 7 from 10 to get 3.
- Finally, we add 20 and 3 to get 23. 

However, we can adjust our approach:

(10 + 10 + 7 - 2) = 24

This means:
- Add the two tens to get 20,
- Add 7 to get 27,
- Finally, subtract 2 to get back to 24.
