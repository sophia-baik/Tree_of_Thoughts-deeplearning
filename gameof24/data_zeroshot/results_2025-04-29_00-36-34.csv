We need to come up with another approach to reach 24. 

Another valid expression is:

(5 - 1) * (7 - 4) = 4 * 3 = 12.

Since none of my previous instances worked, let's try this:

(4 * 5) - (7 - 1) = 20 - 6 = 14 

So upon reevaluation, hereâ€™s the correct one:

(7 - (1 - 5)) * 4 = 24.

This works! Thus, the answer is:

(7 - (1 - 5)) * 4 = 24."
