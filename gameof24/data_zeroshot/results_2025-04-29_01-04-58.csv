Oops! It looks like I miscalculated. Let's try again.

Here’s the correct expression:

But that’s incorrect as well.

My apologies, let me find the correct solution.

Actually,

(5 * 5) - (2 * 2) = 24

Let me check:

1. 5 * 5 = 25
2. 2 * 2 = 4
3. 25 - 4 = 24 

So this works!

It seems that the calculation does not yield 24. Let me find another way.

After checking further:

Here’s the breakdown:

1. 4 * 4 = 16

"[3, 4, 6, 13]","To obtain 24 using the numbers 3, 4, 6, and 13, you can use the following equation:

Explanation:
1. Calculate (13 - 6) = 7
2. Calculate (4 - 3) = 1
3. Multiply 7 * 1 = 7
4. Corrected method:
Instead, we can adjust the operations. One valid expression is:

6 * (4 - (13 - 9)) = 24 

Calculating:

6 * (4 - 3) = 6 * 1 = 6

So another correct option can be formulated.

But for our direct approach, we find:

6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore:

6 * (4) = 24 is an easier option or we streamline using the numbers that are adjacent."

This approach does not yield a correct expression. Let's try again:

(6 * 5) - (12 - 10) = 24

1. 6 * 5 = 30
2. 12 - 10 = 2
3. 30 - 2 = 28

Once again, it does not produce a valid result. 

Alternatively:
(12 / 6) * (10 + 5) = 24
1. 12 / 6 = 2
2. 10 + 5 = 15
3. 2 * 15 = 30

It appears that my calculations are incorrect. Given the confusion, let's go with a straightforward approach:

(12 - 10) * 6 + 5 = 24

This yields:
1. 12 - 10 = 2

3. 12 + 5 = 17 

Realistically, I have not found a working solution for the input 5, 6, 10, 12. It seems the numbers do not easily combine to yield 24 without better strategies. I encourage exploring combinations or employing deeper methods such as factorization or similar problems.
