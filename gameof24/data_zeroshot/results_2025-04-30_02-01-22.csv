"[2, 4, 4, 4]",Answer: (4 * 4) + 4 - 2 = 24
"[1, 1, 11, 13]",Answer: (13 - 11) * (1 + 1) * 12 = 24
"[5, 8, 10, 11]","To obtain 24 using the numbers 5, 8, 10, and 11, you can use the following equation:

(11 - 10) * 8 + 5 = 24

This simplifies to:

1 * 8 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 (and is wrong). 

Let's try again

11 + 10 + 5 - 8 = 24 

So, the answer is: 

11 + 10 + 5 - 8 = 24"
"[1, 2, 4, 12]",Answer: (12 - 4) * (2 + 1) = 24
"[1, 6, 6, 12]",(6 / 6 + 1) * 12 = 24
"[5, 5, 5, 9]",Answer: 5 + 5 + 5 + 9 = 24
"[2, 2, 4, 5]",Answer: (5 - 2) * (4 + 2) = 24
"[1, 3, 7, 13]",Answer: (13 - 7) * (3 + 1) = 24
"[4, 4, 6, 9]",Answer: (9 - 6) * (4 + 4) = 24
"[6, 8, 10, 12]",Answer: (12 - 10) * (8 + 6) = 24
