"[9, 11, 12, 13]","To achieve 24 using the numbers 9, 11, 12, and 13, you can use the following expression:

(13 - 11) * (12 + 9) = 24.

This simplifies as follows:

1. Calculate (13 - 11) = 2.
2. Calculate (12 + 9) = 21.
3. Multiply the results: 2 * 21 = 42.

This doesn't yield the correct result. Let's try another combination.

After evaluating different combinations, we can find:

(12 * 2) = 24.

Where:
2 is derived from the operation (13 - 11). 

So, the solution is:

Here's the breakdown:
- 13 - 11 = 2
- 9 + 2 = 11
- 2 * 11 = 22 (Correction: let's try another operation since this does not lead us to 24.)

Another way to reach 24:

9 * (2 + 11 / 13) = 24
 
This doesn't yield 24. 

Let's conclude with:  (13 - 11) * 9 + 2 = 24 is also incorrect.

Finally, 

(2 * 11) + (9 - 9) =  24.

This leads to:

(2 * 11) + (1 * 9) =  24.

Thus, (9 + 2 + 13) - 11 = 24.

or 

(2 * 11) + 2 - 2 = 24

Thus, none of these lead to 24 accurately. I apologize, I cannot find a combination to validate 24 with the proposed numbers."

The right solution is:
