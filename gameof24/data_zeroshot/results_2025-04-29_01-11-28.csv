"[4, 6, 12, 13]","To achieve 24 using the numbers 4, 6, 12, and 13, we can use the following equation:

(13 - 12) * (6 + 4) = 24

Explanation:
1. Compute (13 - 12) = 1
2. Compute (6 + 4) = 10
3. Then multiply the results: 1 * 10 = 10

It seems the operation didn't yield the correct result. However, let's try another approach:

(4 * 6) - (13 - 12) = 24

Explanation:
1. Compute (4 * 6) = 24
2. Compute (13 - 12) = 1
3. Now we can see that it didn't meet the goal.

A correct arrangement is:

(12 - 4) * 6 / 2 = 24

Let's check it again:

(12 - 6) * 4 + 12 = 24

It might seem challenging using provided numbers for the correct arrangement. 

A simple way is necessary:

( 12 + 13 ) - 6 - 4 + 10

Thus, doable with some rearranging could ultimately yield a result, but based off combinations, please let me know if you seek further numbers that align for future checks or accurate ones!"
