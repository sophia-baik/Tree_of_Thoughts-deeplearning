"[9, 11, 12, 13]","One possible solution to obtain 24 using the numbers 9, 11, 12, and 13 is:

(13 - 11) * (12 - 9) = 24 

Here, (13 - 11) equals 2 and (12 - 9) equals 3. Then, 2 * 3 equals 6. 

Alternatively, you can also do:

(12 - 9) * (13 - 11) * 2 = 24

But the simplest way is:

(12 - (13 - 11)) * (9 - 9) = 24

Which simplifies down to:

(12 - 2) * 2 = 24

This means using a basic subtraction between the different numbers and then multiplying or adding them together will lead us to the correct 24 result."

This simplifies as follows:
1. Calculate (13 - 12) = 1
2. Calculate (9 + 9) = 18
3. Multiply the results: 1 * 18 = 18

It seems I made a mistake, let me try again.

Here's the correct solution:

(9 + 13) - 12 = 10
10 x 2 = 24

Hence, a combination could be (9 + 13 - 12) * 2 = 24, but that last statement won't achieve 24.

Please allow me to clarify further attempts:

(12 - 9) * (13 - 9) = 3 * 4 = 12, no consistent solution.

So unfortunately, I canâ€™t seem to arrive at an arithmetic solution with these numbers that equals 24 in a straightforward calculation. If you have any other number sets, please share, and I'd be happy to assist!"
