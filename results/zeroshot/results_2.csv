1. First, we can combine 12 and 12 to get 24.
2. Then, we'll subtract 11 from 24 to get 13.
3. Finally, subtracting 13 gives us 0, so we will need to rearrange our operations.

Let's try a different way:

1. Multiply 11 and 2 (which we can get by manipulating 12 and operations).
2. Adding the result to 12 gives us 24.

After testing various combinations, the correct one is:

(12 - (13 - 11)) * 2 = 24

Final equation:
(12 - (13 - 11)) * 2 = 24"
"[7, 7, 11, 13]","To reach 24 using the numbers 7, 7, 11, and 13, we can use the following calculation:

(13 - 11) * 7 + 7 = 24

So, the final equation is:

(13 - 11) * 7 + 7 = 24"
"[2, 3, 3, 12]","One way to reach 24 using the numbers 2, 3, 3, and 12 is:

(3 * 12) - (3 * 2)

Final equation:
(3 * 12) - (3 * 2) = 24"
