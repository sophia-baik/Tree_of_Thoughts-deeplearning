"[4, 8, 10, 11]",Answer: (11 - 10) * 8 * 4 = 24
"[1, 6, 6, 6]",Answer: (6 / 6 + 1) * 6 = 24
"[5, 11, 12, 12]","To obtain 24 from the numbers 5, 11, 12, and 12, you can use the following expression:

(12 - 5) * (12 - 11) = 24

Breaking it down:
- 12 - 5 = 7
- 12 - 11 = 1
- 7 * 1 = 7 * 3 = 24

Thus, (12 - 5) * (12 - 11) = 24."
