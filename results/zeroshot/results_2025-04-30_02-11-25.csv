"[5, 6, 11, 12]",Answer: (12 - 11) * (6 + 5) = 24
"[3, 3, 11, 13]",Answer: (13 - 11) * (3 + 3) = 24
"[1, 1, 11, 12]",Answer: (12 - 11) * (1 + 1) * 12 = 24
"[7, 8, 11, 12]",Answer: (12 - 8) * (11 - 7) = 24
"[2, 4, 9, 13]","One possible way to get 24 from the numbers 2, 4, 9, and 13 is:

(13 - 9) * (4 + 2) = 24"
"[3, 3, 3, 12]",Answer: (12 - 3) * (3 - 3) + 12 = 24
"[2, 3, 5, 11]","To obtain 24 using the numbers 2, 3, 5, and 11, we can use the following equation:

(11 - 5) * (3 + 2) = 24

Breaking it down:
- 11 - 5 = 6
- 3 + 2 = 5
- 6 * 5 = 30

Note: The initial response was incorrect, and I apologize for that. Letâ€™s try again.

A valid equation is:

(5 * 3) + (11 - 2) = 24

Which simplifies to:
- 5 * 3 = 15
- 11 - 2 = 9
- 15 + 9 = 24

So the answer is:
(5 * 3) + (11 - 2) = 24"
"[3, 4, 11, 12]",(12 - 11) * (4 + 3) = 24
"[2, 8, 8, 12]",Answer: (12 - 8) * 8 + 2 = 24
"[1, 2, 9, 13]","To obtain 24 using the numbers 1, 2, 9, and 13, we can use the following expression:

(13 - 9) * (2 + 1) = 24

Here's the breakdown:
1. Calculate (13 - 9) = 4
2. Calculate (2 + 1) = 3
3. Then multiply the two results: 4 * 3 = 12

It actually seems I miscalculated you will need \(3 * 8 = 24\) with different numbers.

Let me provide a correct calculation: 

By re-arranging numbers or combinations you can set 
(9 - 1) * 2 + 13 = 24. 

Apologies for the confusion. "
