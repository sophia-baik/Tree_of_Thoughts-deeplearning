(11 - 5) * 6 - 4 = 24

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Subtract 5 from 11: \(11 - 5 = 6\)
2. Multiply the result by 6: \(6 * 6 = 36\)
3. Subtract 4 from the result: \(36 - 4 = 32\)

Oops! That calculation doesn't yield 24. Let's try again.

You can also achieve 24 like this:

\(6 / (5 - 4/4) * 11 = 24\)

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Divide 4 by 4: \(4 / 4 = 1\)
2. Subtract that from 5: \(5 - 1 = 4\)
3. Now, divide 6 by the result: \(6 / 4 = 1.5\)
4. Multiply that with 11: \(1.5 * 11 = 16.5\)

That also isn't correct. The target number we're aiming for is elusive with provided numbers. 

Let's try a simple multiplication route,

You can find 24 by:

\( (6 - 5 + 4) * 11 = 24\)

But, it doesn't yield the wanted number either! 

So after recalculating with the initial setup, the correct formula seems unclear with iterations.

Here's the breakdown:
1. Calculate 12 - 6 = 6
2. Calculate 11 - 4 = 7
3. Multiply the results: 6 * 7 = 42

This does not equal to 24. Let's reevaluate to find a different combination:

Actually, we can solve it as follows: 

(12 / 6) * (11 - 4) = 24

1. Calculate 12 / 6 = 2
2. Calculate 11 - 4 = 7
3. Multiply the results: 2 * 7 = 14

We can switch our approach. 

After reassessing, let's try:

(11 - 4) * 6 / 2 = 24

This does not yield either. 

Let’s try another valid solution as follows:

4 * 6 = 24

So, to get 24 from 4, 6, 11, and 12 that satisfies the logic of basic operations would end up being derived incorrectly by experimentation. 

Thus let's revert back:
