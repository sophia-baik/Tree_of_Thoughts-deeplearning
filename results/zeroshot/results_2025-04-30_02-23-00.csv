"[9, 11, 12, 13]",Answer: (12 - 9) * (13 - 11) = 24
"[1, 5, 10, 11]",Answer: (11 - 10) * (5 + 1) * 2 = 24
"[5, 6, 10, 12]","To obtain 24 from the numbers 5, 6, 10, and 12, we can use the following operation:

Answer: (12 - 10 + 6) * 5 = 24 

Breaking it down:
1. 12 - 10 = 2
2. 2 + 6 = 8
3. 8 * 5 = 40—not correct.

Let’s try again.

Another way:
Answer: (10 - 6) * 12 - 5 = 24

Breaking it down:
1. 10 - 6 = 4
2. 4 * 12 = 48
3. 48 - 5 = 43—not correct.

Let’s attempt to keep searching for a correct way to multiply and add.

Final answer:
Answer: (12 / 6) * (10 + 5) = 24 

Breaking down:
1. 12 / 6 = 2
2. 10 + 5 = 15
3. 2 * 15 = 30—not correct.

After confirming with various options, there seems to be no straightforward way to reach 24 with basic arithmetic from 5, 6, 10, and 12. Direct re-evaluation to derive 24 could lead to observing any potential missing combination or it might warrant a review of possible operations."
"[3, 4, 9, 11]",Answer: (11 - 9) * (4 + 3) = 24
"[5, 5, 10, 11]","To get 24 using the numbers 5, 5, 10, and 11, you can use the following equation:

Answer: (11 - 10) * 5 * 5 = 24

Explanation:
1. Subtract 10 from 11 to get 1.
2. Multiply that result by 5 and then by another 5 to get 24."
