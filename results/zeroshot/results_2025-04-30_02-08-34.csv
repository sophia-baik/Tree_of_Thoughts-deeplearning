"[10, 11, 11, 12]",Answer: (12 - 10) * (11 + 11) = 24
"[1, 6, 12, 12]","One way to obtain 24 using the numbers 1, 6, 12, and 12 is:

(12 / 6) * (12 + 1) = 24

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
1. Calculate \( 12 / 6 = 2 \)
2. Calculate \( 12 + 1 = 13 \)
3. Multiply \( 2 * 13 = 26 \)

Oops! That's incorrect. Let's try this instead:

(12 * 2) = 24, where \( 2 = (12 - 12 + 6) \)

So we can express it as:

(12 * (12 / 12) + 6) = 24
