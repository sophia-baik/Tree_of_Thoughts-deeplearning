"[6, 7, 10, 12]","To obtain 24 from the numbers 6, 7, 10, and 12, you can use the following operation:

(12 - 10) * (7 + 6) = 24

This simplifies as follows:

1. 12 - 10 = 2
2. 7 + 6 = 13
3. 2 * 13 = 26, but it seems I made an error.

Actually, a correct operation would be:

(10 - 6) * 7 + 12 = 24

Breaking that down:

1. 10 - 6 = 4
2. 4 * 7 = 28
3. 28 - 12 = 24

So another valid equation could be:

(12 - 6) * 7 - 10 = 24, but this one isn't valid since it won't land directly on 24!

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct that to:

**(12 - 10) * (7 + 6) + 6** 

However, rechecking, clearly, simple manipulation isn't working in my output. 

So the conclusive output could revolve around addition for clearer:

Using another combination:

4 + 12 + 8 = 24

But for precisely those numbers 6, 7, 10, 12 gets tricky!

An overall redistribution needs clearer calculation, but I realize while summing I tend to double count so separating to initial will yield way:

*(10-6)*(12-7)=*

Thus I conclude sometimes my arithmetic seems amiss, working better tracks from connecting basics sums!

Please feel free to use my earlier operations if you devise unique outputs!"
