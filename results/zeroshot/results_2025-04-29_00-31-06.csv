"[5, 6, 8, 13]","To reach 24 using the numbers 5, 6, 8, and 13, you can use the following expression:

(13 - 5) * (8 - 6) = (8) * (2) = 16 (incorrect, let's try another)

The correct approach is:

(8 + 6 + 5 - 13) = 6, thus we need to look again.

An alternative approach: 

Using addition and basic arithmetic:

5 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 24

However, since that doesn't work and I misunderstood. 

One valid approach will look like:

(8 * 3) = 24 since the closest number above is to include.

(13 - 5) * (8 - 6) = 16 (still incorrect)

Thus, since my basic approach goes wrong, let me correct and provide.

Indeed since the formed number becomes complex in fast arithmetic, take this version totally like:

(13 + 5) - (6 + 8) = 0 and from arithmetical up to 24 direction found in a wrong formula for divide. 

Let me find a right one:

Using different combinations:

Simply and correctly;

(8 + 6) * 2 = 24 

Since I apologize for my prior transgressions in finding a linear output quickly and seeking various combinations to yield 24 correctly."

"[5, 6, 9, 9]","Answer: (5 * 6) - (9 - 9) = 30 - 0 = 30 (Oops, that doesn't work. Let's find a valid solution.)

Correct Answer: (9 - 5) * 9 + 6 = 4 * 9 + 6 = 36 + 6 = 42 (Oops again, let's try again)

Final Answer: (9 - 6) * (9 + 5) = 3 * 14 = 42 (Still not correct!)

After revisiting, here's a valid one:

(6 / (9 - 9 + 5)) * 9 = (6/5) * 9 = 10.8 (Still not adding to 24. Rethinking…)

Correct are: (9 + 9 + 5) - 6 = 18 + 6= 24

So let's keep working on refining:

Okay, actually here;

(9 - 5) * 6 = 24!
