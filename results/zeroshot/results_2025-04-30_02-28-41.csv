"[4, 5, 11, 13]","One possible way to obtain 24 from the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 13 is:

(13 - 11) * (5 + 4) = 24

Here’s how it works:
1. 13 - 11 = 2
2. 5 + 4 = 9
3. 2 * 9 = 18

I made a mistake with that equation; let’s try again.

Another way to reach 24 is:

(11 - 5) * (4 + 13 - 11) = 24

1. 11 - 5 = 6
2. 4 + (13 - 11) = 4 + 2 = 6
3. 6 * 6 = 36 

Let’s adjust that back to:

(4 * 5) - (13 - 11) = 24

But that also won't work because:

20 - 2 = 18

Let's find the right combinations.

Correct way to reach 24:

(11 + 13 - 5 - 4) = 24.

1. 11 + 13 = 24
2. 24 - (5 + 4) = 24

Final correct method:

(11 + 13) / (4 / 4) = 24 as well.

But looks complex. 

The straightforward numbers making it are not clear and correct with just calculations, keep checking.

Final Resolution:

(13 - 5 + 4 - 11)=24,
that doesn't add up!

Let’s summarize:

To achieve 24 with [4, 5, 11, 13], we have not reached accurate straightforward answers but we've explored bounds to obtain outputs higher or lower, yet still seeking.

Thus suggest recalibrating inputs if needing refined output making or breakpoints to build:
